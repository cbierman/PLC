I will purchase your accounts receivable invoices! Are you waiting 30 days or longer to get paid for work you've already completed? Is it difficult to grow your business because you're constantly waiting for invoices to be paid? I have the solution you've been looking for! I will purchase your invoices and wait for your clients to pay. Here's an example of how it works:

You complete work and invoice your client for $1000.00. You sell the invoice to me and I will direct deposit funds between 70% - 90% ($700 - $900) of the invoice value in your checking account. Once your client pays the invoice in full, I will rebate the remaining 30% - 10% ($300 - $100) minus a small fee (usually around 3%). 

This is not a loan. If you have a commercial client with a proven track record of paying invoices, you qualify! It's as easy as that!
