The house is at ... Street, Iowa City, IA, 52240. It will be available for rent from January 1st, 2015 until July 31st, 2015. I may move out a week earlier in December, so it may be possible to move in early. The house is about a 5 minute bike ride to campus and has plenty of parking on the street, and two spots in the drive way.

The room is a decent size, clean, and comes with the large closet in the hallway as well. I can leave my wooden podium and bookshelf if you'd like those with the room. My roommates are a mix of students and professionals who are very easy to get along with.

As stated in the title, rent is $400 per month plus utilities from the time you take over the lease. I will give you $400 cash to cover first months rent as Spring-Summer leases are less likely to be filled.

If you have any questions or would like to check things out, give me a call or email.
